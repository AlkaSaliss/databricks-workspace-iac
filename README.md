# Databricks Workspace Infrastructure as Code

This project provides Terraform modules and Terragrunt configurations to deploy Databricks workspaces on AWS, with a focus on Unity Catalog setup.

## Overview

The infrastructure is organized into reusable Terraform modules and environment-specific Terragrunt configurations. This allows for consistent deployments across multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) and regions.

## Modules

This project contains the following core Terraform modules:

- **[Account Admin (`account-admin`)](./doc/account-admin.md)**: Manages Databricks account-level resources such as users, groups, and service principals. This is typically the first module to be deployed to set up account-level prerequisites.
- **[Terraform State Infrastructure (`terraform-state-infra`)]](./doc/terraform-state-infra.md)**: Provisions the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table required for managing Terraform's remote state and state locking. This module should be deployed once per AWS account/region where you intend to manage Terraform state.
- **[Unity Catalog AWS Infrastructure (`uc-aws-infra`)]](./doc/uc-aws-infra.md)**: Deploys the complete AWS infrastructure needed for a Databricks workspace integrated with Unity Catalog. This includes VPC, S3 buckets for root storage and metastore, IAM roles, and the Databricks workspace and metastore resources themselves.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Terraform, Terragrunt, and AWS CLI installed and configured.
2.  **Configure Backend**: Deploy the `terraform-state-infra` module (or ensure you have an S3 backend and DynamoDB table ready).
3.  **Set Environment Variables**: Export necessary environment variables for Databricks authentication (e.g., `DATABRICKS_ACCOUNT_ID`, `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID`, `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET`).
4.  **Review `env.hcl` and `region.hcl`**: Update these files in your target environment directory (e.g., `src/environments/dev/eu-west-1/`) with appropriate values.
5.  **Update `terraform.tfvars`**: For each component in your environment (e.g., `src/environments/dev/eu-west-1/account-admin/terraform.tfvars`), copy the `.tfvars.example` file if it exists and populate it with your specific inputs.
6.  **Use Makefile**: The provided `Makefile` contains convenient targets for initializing, planning, and applying the configurations. 
    Example commands:
    ```bash
    # Show help
    make help

    # Initialize a specific component in dev/eu-west-1
    make init ENV=dev REGION=eu-west-1 COMPONENT=account-admin

    # Plan a component (defaults to dev/eu-west-1/account-admin if not specified)
    make plan COMPONENT=uc-aws-infra

    # Apply all components in dev
    make dev-apply-all REGION=eu-west-1
    ```
